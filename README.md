# Driving Towards Safety: A Data-Driven Approach to Predicting Accident Severity

## Overview
This project leverages the **US Accidents Dataset** to predict the severity of accidents based on environmental and road infrastructure factors. By using machine learning techniques, it aims to provide actionable insights to mitigate high-severity accidents.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: Includes historical accident data from 49 U.S. states (2016-2023).
- **Machine Learning**: Built and optimized an **XGBoost Classifier**, achieving an accuracy of **76%**.
- **Key Factors**: Identified critical features like **traffic signals, weather conditions, and visibility** affecting accident severity.
- **Actionable Insights**: Suggested measures like **adaptive traffic signals** and improved road lighting.
